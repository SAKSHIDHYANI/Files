This project is based on US bikeshare data project. This is my first project using python . Bikeshare data of Chicago , Washington and 
New York has been used in this project. Using that ,analysis has been performed and  various inferences has been drawn. I have worked on providing 
user statistics , trip duration statistics and many other statistics providing information about the data so we can see the trends.
