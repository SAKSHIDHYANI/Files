This project is based on US bikeshare data project. This is my first project using python . Bikeshare data of Chicago , Washington and 
New York was available to me . Using that I have tried to analyse that data to calculate various statistics. I have worked on providing 
user statistics , trip duration statistics and many other sattistics providing information about the data so we can see the trends.
